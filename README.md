Visualize Net Foreign Investment Received in PAK by different Countries


Using State Bank of Pakistan's dataset, I have tried to visualize the Net Foreign Investment Received in PAK from different countries for the period of last 10 years.

The application is built using Tkinter framework in Python 3.9 version. This efforts is an attempt to address a gap in current visualiztion of same data set on SBP's website. Existing graphs only displays graph from a specific time period, however, this desktop application shows entire timeline in a single frame.

To use, copy or download project file and run on local computer. 

Thanks. 

Notice: good gui was kept on low priority.
